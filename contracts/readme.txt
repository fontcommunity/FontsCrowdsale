Fonts subconsciously affect human psychology and decision-making. Certain fonts can make us believe the information is true. Some will make you feel fake. An experiment by @michaelbierut and @errolmorris reveals that. More about the experiment here http://eyeondesign.aiga.org/can-a-font-make-us-believe-something-is-true/

Certain fonts increase sales in restaurants if menus are in a fancy font. A study by Psychologist @aanobs and Hyunjin Song shows that people believe the fancier the font is, the more skilled the chef is. http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/simple-fonts.htm

In the Same study, Hyunjin Song and Norbert Schwarz of the University of Michigan found that when people were given a task, those who got fancy fonts estimated the task would take nearly twice as long.

In the same way, we need to make the market decide on fonts by making them NFT. By doing so, we let designers go with the rhythm and produce art that may be lost forever. 

Who knows, we may get a font that can create enough self-confidence by just reading through it.

Or we may get a font that feels connected to our ancestors, loved ones and history, etc. 

Or we may get a font that will open up our spiritual side.
